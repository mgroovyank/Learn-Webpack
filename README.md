# Learn-Webpack

This is the code that I wrote for Colt Steele's 10 part course on YouTube - Learn Webpack

This 10-part course teaches Webpack from scratch.  
It begins with a simple question: "What is webpack?"  
Quickly we move on to installing Webpack, configuring it, and adding loaders for CSS, SASS, HTML, and Files.  
The course covers cache busting, setting up a dev server, and splitting up your development and production config files.
We incorporate multiple Webpack plugins including clean-webpack-plugin, mini-css-extract-plugin,
optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin, terser-webpack-plugin, and html-webpack-plugin.
